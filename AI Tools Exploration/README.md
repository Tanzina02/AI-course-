## 🎯 Choosing the Right AI Tools

Before creating the presentation and video, I explored several AI content-generation tools to identify the most efficient and creative platforms.

| Purpose | Tools Explored | Key Observations | Final Choice |
|----------|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| 🎤 **Presentation** | Canva Magic Slides, Tome AI, Gamma AI | - Canva offered aesthetic designs but less AI control.<br>- Tome was fast but lacked fine customization.<br>- **Gamma balanced automation + flexibility.** | ✅ **Gamma AI** |
| 🎥 **Video Creation** | Synthesia, Pictory, InVideo | - Synthesia focused more on avatars than story-based visuals.<br>- Pictory had limited editing control.<br>- **InVideo offered excellent AI scripting + manual fine-tuning.** | ✅ **InVideo AI** |
