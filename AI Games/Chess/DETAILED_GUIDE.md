## Game Setup

### Imports and Configuration
```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import simpledialog, messagebox
import chess
import math

# -----------------------------
# CONFIGURATION
# -----------------------------
AI_DEPTH = 2
SQUARE_SIZE = 72
SELECT_COLOR = "#FFD54F"
LEGAL_MOVE_COLOR = "#90CAF9"
LIGHT_COLOR = "#F0D9B5"
DARK_COLOR = "#B58863"
FONT_FAMILY = "Segoe UI Symbol"
FONT_SIZE = 40 
```

**Explanation (15–20 lines):**

1. We import `tkinter` for GUI and event handling.
2. `simpledialog` and `messagebox` handle user prompts and notifications.
3. `chess` provides board representation, legal moves, and piece logic.
4. `math` is used for evaluation in Minimax and infinity constants.
5. `AI_DEPTH` sets how many moves ahead AI will analyze.
6. `SQUARE_SIZE` sets pixel size of each chessboard square.
7. `SELECT_COLOR` is used to highlight the selected piece.
8. `LEGAL_MOVE_COLOR` highlights possible moves for selected pieces.
9. `LIGHT_COLOR` and `DARK_COLOR` alternate to create the chessboard pattern.
10. `FONT_FAMILY` and `FONT_SIZE` define the font for chess symbols.
11. These constants make the code modular and easily configurable.
12. Separation of configuration ensures UI and AI are independent of logic changes.
13. The global variables are procedural-style for simple state management.
14. They define how both the board and AI will behave.
15. This segment establishes the foundation for GUI, AI, and user interaction.
```


### Tkinter GUI Setup

```python
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Human vs AI Chess (Procedural)")
canvas = tk.Canvas(root, width=8*SQUARE_SIZE, height=8*SQUARE_SIZE, highlightthickness=0)
canvas.pack()
status_lbl = tk.Label(root, text="You: White  —  AI: Black", font=("Arial", 12))
status_lbl.pack(fill="x")
```

**Explanation (15–20 lines):**

1. `root = tk.Tk()` creates the main window.
2. `root.title` sets a descriptive title for the game.
3. `canvas` is used to draw the chessboard and pieces.
4. Canvas dimensions are set to accommodate 8x8 squares.
5. `highlightthickness=0` removes default border.
6. `canvas.pack()` places the canvas on the window.
7. `status_lbl` displays player information (human vs AI).
8. The label updates dynamically if needed.
9. Tkinter's canvas allows precise control over squares and pieces.
10. GUI and game logic are separated for modularity.
11. This procedural setup avoids class complexity for beginners.
12. Canvas allows us to redraw after every move.
13. Mouse events will be bound to this canvas.
14. The initial setup creates the interface visible to users.
15. This segment prepares the game for interactive play.

## Board Rendering

### Drawing the Chessboard

```python
def draw_board():
    canvas.delete("all")
    for r in range(8):
        for c in range(8):
            sq = chess.square(c, 7-r)
            x1, y1 = c * SQUARE_SIZE, r * SQUARE_SIZE
            x2, y2 = x1 + SQUARE_SIZE, y1 + SQUARE_SIZE
            color = LIGHT_COLOR if (r + c) % 2 == 0 else DARK_COLOR
            if selected_square == sq:
                color = SELECT_COLOR
            elif sq in legal_destinations:
                color = LEGAL_MOVE_COLOR
            canvas.create_rectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, fill=color, outline="")
```

**Explanation (15–20 lines):**

1. Deletes previous drawings to redraw the updated board.
2. Loops through all rows and columns (8x8).
3. Calculates top-left and bottom-right coordinates for each square.
4. Alternates light and dark colors for chessboard pattern.
5. Highlights the selected square with `SELECT_COLOR`.
6. Highlights legal move destinations for clarity.
7. `canvas.create_rectangle` draws the square.
8. This function is called after every move to update visuals.
9. Visual highlights guide the player to understand legal moves.
10. The procedure avoids object-oriented complexity.
11. Updates are efficient for small GUI like chessboard.
12. Redrawing ensures pieces stay aligned with board.
13. Procedural design keeps global state simple.
14. Helps AI and human moves remain synchronized visually.
15. Can be extended to show coordinates, last move highlights, or check indicators.

### Piece Symbols

```python
piece_symbols = {
    chess.PAWN: ('♙','♟'),
    chess.KNIGHT: ('♘','♞'),
    chess.BISHOP: ('♗','♝'),
    chess.ROOK: ('♖','♜'),
    chess.QUEEN: ('♕','♛'),
    chess.KING: ('♔','♚')
}

def draw_pieces():
    for sq in chess.SQUARES:
        piece = board.piece_at(sq)
        if piece:
            r, c = 7 - chess.square_rank(sq), chess.square_file(sq)
            x, y = c*SQUARE_SIZE + SQUARE_SIZE//2, r*SQUARE_SIZE + SQUARE_SIZE//2
            sym = piece_symbols[piece.piece_type][0 if piece.color == chess.WHITE else 1]
            canvas.create_text(x, y, text=sym, font=(FONT_FAMILY, FONT_SIZE), fill="black")
```

**Explanation (15–20 lines):**

1. Maps chess piece types to Unicode symbols.
2. Each piece has separate symbols for White and Black.
3. `draw_pieces()` iterates over all board squares.
4. Uses `board.piece_at` to determine piece type and color.
5. Calculates exact pixel position for piece text.
6. Centers symbol in the square using half-square offset.
7. `canvas.create_text` renders the symbol with specified font.
8. Fill color can be changed for better contrast.
9. Called after `draw_board()` to overlay pieces.
10. Keeps GUI rendering separate from AI logic.
11. Highlights or selection can be overlaid without altering symbols.
12. Supports Unicode symbols across platforms.
13. Efficiently draws 32 pieces without loops nesting unnecessarily.
14. Can be extended for custom graphics or images.
15. Allows full board visualization with accurate piece positions.

### Click Handling

```python
def coord_to_square(x, y):
    col = x // SQUARE_SIZE
    row_from_top = y // SQUARE_SIZE
    row = 7 - row_from_top
    return chess.square(col, row)

def on_click(event):
    global selected_square, legal_destinations
    sq = coord_to_square(event.x, event.y)
    # Further logic to select, move, and highlight pieces
```

**Explanation (15–20 lines):**

1. Converts mouse click coordinates to board square.
2. Calculates column and row using integer division.
3. Adjusts for chessboard top-to-bottom coordinate system.
4. `chess.square` converts file and rank to square index.
5. `on_click` handles mouse events from Tkinter canvas.
6. Tracks currently selected square for user moves.
7. Highlights legal moves for user guidance.
8. Manages state globally in procedural style.
9. Click events trigger move validation.
10. Supports both piece selection and destination selection.
11. Avoids complex object-oriented callbacks.
12. Provides immediate feedback on valid moves.
13. Coordinates system ensures proper mapping to chess rules.
14. Facilitates AI turn after human makes move.
15. Foundation for user interaction, move selection, and game loop.

## AI Implementation

### Board Evaluation

```python
piece_values = {chess.PAWN:100, chess.KNIGHT:320, chess.BISHOP:330, chess.ROOK:500, chess.QUEEN:900, chess.KING:20000}

def evaluate_board(board):
    score = 0
    for pt, val in piece_values.items():
        score += val * len(board.pieces(pt, chess.BLACK))
        score -= val * len(board.pieces(pt, chess.WHITE))
    return score
```

**Explanation (15–20 lines):**

1. Assigns weighted values to each chess piece.
2. King has very high value to prioritize survival.
3. Pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queen have standard chess values.
4. Iterates through all piece types.
5. Adds points for Black pieces (AI) and subtracts for White (Human).
6. The score represents board favorability for AI.
7. Used as heuristic for Minimax evaluation.
8. Provides numerical guidance for AI decision-making.
9. Simple material-based evaluation; no positional heuristics yet.
10. Quick computation ensures low-latency AI moves.
11. Recursively called for each leaf node in Minimax.
12. Score directly impacts which move AI will choose.
13. Errors in this function can make AI play sub-optimally.
14. Combined with alpha-beta pruning for efficient deep search.
15. Forms the foundation of AI's strategic thinking.

### Minimax Algorithm

```python
def minimax(board, depth, alpha, beta, maximizing_player):
    # Recursive Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning
    pass
```

**Explanation (15–20 lines):**

1. Recursively evaluates board positions for AI decision.
2. `depth` limits lookahead to control performance.
3. `maximizing_player` determines whose turn to evaluate.
4. Base case: game over or depth zero → evaluate_board().
5. Loops through legal moves and pushes them to the board.
6. Recursively calls itself with decreased depth.
7. Pops moves to restore board state after evaluation.
8. Uses `alpha` and `beta` to prune unneeded branches.
9. Pruning drastically reduces number of evaluations.
10. Maximizing node chooses highest score; minimizing chooses lowest.
11. Supports efficient decision-making for procedural AI.
12. Works together with evaluation function to choose optimal moves.
13. Handles mid-game, endgame, and tactical scenarios.
14. Avoids exploring moves that cannot improve outcome.
15. Ensures AI makes strong and timely moves.

### Best Move Selection

```python
def best_move_for_ai(board, depth=AI_DEPTH):
    best_move = None
    best_score = -math.inf
    for mv in board.legal_moves:
        board.push(mv)
        score = minimax(board, depth-1, -math.inf, math.inf, False)
        board.pop()
        if score > best_score:
            best_score = score
            best_move = mv
    return best_move
```

**Explanation (15–20 lines):**

1. Iterates through all legal moves to find the optimal one.
2. Uses `minimax` evaluation recursively.
3. Keeps track of best score and move.
4. Push/pop ensures board state remains intact.
5. Returns the move maximizing AI’s advantage.
6. Depth parameter controls AI difficulty.
7. Efficiently selects moves combining evaluation + pruning.
8. Works with material evaluation and Minimax.
9. Guarantees AI plays the strongest move within depth limit.
10. Called immediately after human move.
11. Ensures smooth turn-based gameplay.
12. Easy to adjust AI difficulty by changing depth.
13. Supports expansion to more advanced evaluation heuristics.
14. Ensures predictable and understandable AI behavior.
15. Key function linking evaluation and actual AI gameplay.

def show_result():
    # Uses messagebox to show winner or draw
    pass
```

**Explanation (15–20 lines):**

1. Detects if the game is over.
2. Checks for checkmate: announces winner.
3. Checks for stalemate or insufficient material: announces draw.
4. Uses `board.result()` for result string.
5. Shows message using Tkinter `messagebox`.
